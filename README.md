# Big_Data_Bowl_2025
This is my groups submission for the 2025 Big Data Bowl Submission. This was completed my Chris Marfisi (myself), Jarrett Markman, Jonah Soos, and Izzie Alfonso.

For our submission "showing your hand", we specifically focused on the distinct motions – or tells – that offenses use, and how defenses can “best respond”, based on the information presented to them based on the offensive formation and motion. We built a k-means cluster model to identify the unique motion types for each player on each play in each game pre-snap. We defined distinct motion types and used those results to build a shiny app that lets a user select the motion and formation by the offense (and the option to guess rush/pass) and look at the historical EPA/play by defensive coverage, to identify the best way(s) for defenses to respond based on the pre-snap information given by the offense.
